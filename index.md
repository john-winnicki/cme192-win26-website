## Course Overview
This short course runs for **eight weeks/eight lectures** and is offered in the **Winter quarter** during the academic year. It is intended for both students with prior programming experience who are expected to use MATLAB in math, science, or engineering courses, and for ambitious students with no prior programming experience.

It consists of **interactive lectures** and **application-based assignments**. The goal of the course is to make students fluent in MATLAB and to provide familiarity with its wide array of features, in real-world settings. We will have a special emphasis on learning how to actually apply MATLAB *outside* of a classroom setting.

The course introduces essential MATLAB programming concepts and data structures, and builds toward applied scientific computing workflows involving visualization, numerical linear algebra, simulation, machine learning, and toolbox-driven analysis in realistic problem settings.

In order to keep the workload appropriate for students who don't have experience with MATLAB, students will have the option to submit their Onramp certifications in place of the first part of Assignment 1. 

Nice-to-haves (helpful but not required): familiarity with **machine learning**, **statistics**, **ODEs/PDEs**, **optimization**, and **image/signal processing**.

## Getting Started with MATLAB
This course focuses on MATLAB programming and the techniques/tools used day-to-day by engineers and industry professionals. We don’t expect prior MATLAB experience, but we do expect students to spend the **first week** becoming familiar with the language. The first lecture is designed to bring students up to speed on basic MATLAB syntax and capabilities.

Each assignment will be a set of computational tasks leveraging tools in the MATLAB toolboxes covered in lecture.
- You may work **individually or in teams**.
- Optional **team matching** forms will be provided for students looking to connect with others.

**Due dates (Winter 2026):**
- Assignment 1 due: **February 15**
- Assignment 2 due: **March 15**

If you need flexibility due to extenuating circumstances, email the instructor.

### Attendance
Students are expected to attend at least **four** class sessions.
- Attendance is recorded using a sign-in sheet distributed at the beginning of each lecture.
- If you anticipate missing more than four classes, use **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSce2qZOaSml7rJGJDIGuEqB_hmff-bSjLhSg6jtlLQqUU7C3Q/viewform?usp=dialog)** to explain additional absences. I’m very understanding of competing deadlines, unexpected situations, or personal circumstances you may not wish to share in detail. I simply ask that you keep me informed about your timelines. Keeping me in the loop helps me pace the course appropriately and check in if you start falling behind!

### Grade breakdown
Final grades are determined using:
- **Assignment 1 / OnRamp certification:** 33%
- **Assignment 2:** 33%
- **Attendance:** 34%

### Late policy
- You may submit an assignment up to **72 hours** after the deadline for a **10% penalty**, without special justification.
- For excused late submissions, request late days at least **24 hours before** the due date using **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSce2qZOaSml7rJGJDIGuEqB_hmff-bSjLhSg6jtlLQqUU7C3Q/viewform?usp=dialog)**. Students must provide a reason when requesting late days.
- There is **no penalty** for instructor-approved late submissions. Again, I’m very understanding of the fact that students often have overlapping academic deadlines, research commitments, interviews, travel, or other routine obligations. Just let me know about your situation so we can make sure you're staying on track!

### Regrades
After receiving a grade on Gradescope, you may request a regrade through the Gradescope interface. To help with logistics, please submit regrade requests within **1 week** after the grade has been released.

## What You Can Expect from the Instructional Team
I am here to guide your learning and will challenge you to actively engage in the learning process through class activities, assignments, and more. I will strive for an inclusive and collaborative classroom and welcome suggestions for improvement. I will do my best to give you the tools, feedback, and support to succeed, so let me know if I can do anything more. 

Learning is a never-ending process, so I hope to motivate students to seek more information on topics we don’t have time to cover. I want to support you all in this learning experience! 

The best way to reach me is by **email** or **Slack**. You should expect a response **within three business days** (but often much sooner!).

## Respect for Diversity
We intend that students from all diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and situations be well served by this course, and that the diversity students bring is viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit.

Materials and activities are intended to be respectful of diversity, including (but not limited to) gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, political affiliation, culture, and more. We acknowledge there is likely a diversity of access to resources among students, and we will do our best to support everyone.

If any class meetings conflict with religious events, please let us know so we can make arrangements.

### Names and pronouns
All people have the right to be addressed and referred to in accordance with their personal identity. You will have the chance to indicate the name you prefer to be called (via the survey on Canvas) and, if you choose, identify pronouns with which you would like to be addressed.

## Support Services
If you are experiencing challenges that create barriers to learning (e.g., increased anxiety, difficulty concentrating, or other stressors), Stanford provides confidential mental health services and support.
- CAPS & Wellness: [vaden.stanford.edu/caps-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services-caps](https://vaden.stanford.edu/caps-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services-caps)

## Access and Accommodations
Stanford is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for disabled students. Disabled students are a valued and essential part of the Stanford community.

If you experience a disability, please register with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE):
- OAE site: [oae.stanford.edu](https://oae.stanford.edu)  
- OAE location: 563 Salvatierra Walk; phone: 723-1066  

If you already have an Academic Accommodation Letter, please share it as early as possible so we can coordinate support and address any barriers to access and inclusion.

## Honor Code and Office of Community Standards
We take the Honor Code very seriously. Students must not give or receive unpermitted aid in examinations or class work, including the preparation of reports or any other work used as the basis of grading. The student who lets others copy their work is as responsible as those who copy.

Violations include (at minimum):
- copying material from another student,
- copying previous years’ solution sets,
- copying solutions found using Google,
- copying solutions found on the internet.

Suspected violations may be reported without warning, and the Office of Community Standards (OCS) determines whether a violation occurred (sometimes after the quarter has ended).

Please do not post any material from this class online. This encourages Honor Code violations, penalizes other students, and can violate copyright.

Homework is designed to help you learn the material—you lose the benefits if someone hands you the solution.

If found guilty of a violation, your grade will be lowered by at least one letter grade.
